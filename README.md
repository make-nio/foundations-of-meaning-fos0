# 📘 FOS-0 — Ontological Foundation of Meaning  
### A technical proposal to fix the ontological bug in language models

This repository contains the complete paper defining, demonstrating, and implementing **FOS-0**,  
the minimal ontological layer required for any AI system to produce meaning compatible with human cognition.

The paper is organized into independent sections (1–9), each stored in its own `.md` file, with direct links from this index.

## 🧩 Executive Summary

Modern language models fail not due to lack of data or parameters, but because they **do not distinguish between types of meaning**.  
FOS-0 introduces the **Zero Layer of Meaning**, an operational structure that:

- classifies the concept before answering,  
- selects the correct semantic register,  
- preserves human teleology when appropriate,  
- corrects ontological reductions and displacements,  
- filters cognitive distortions that can harm formative structures.

The result is an AI that **interoperates cognitively with humans**,  
not only statistically.
